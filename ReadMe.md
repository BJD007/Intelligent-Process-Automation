# Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) Demonstration Project

To demonstrate Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), here is a project that combines RPA, AI, and process analytics. This project automates customer support ticket classification and routing, incorporating machine learning for intelligent decision-making.

## Project: Intelligent Customer Support Ticket Automation

### Objective
Develop an IPA system that automatically classifies incoming customer support tickets, routes them to the appropriate department, and provides initial responses based on historical data.

### Components
1. **RPA**: Automate ticket extraction from email/web forms
2. **AI/ML**: Classify tickets and generate initial responses
3. **Process Analytics**: Monitor system performance and provide insights

### Implementation
Python-based implementation to demonstrate the concept: `IPA_Demo.py`

## Key IPA Concepts Demonstrated

1. **RPA**: Automated ticket extraction (simulated with CSV reading)
2. **AI/ML**: Text classification using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
3. **Process Automation**: Automatic ticket routing and initial response generation
4. **Analytics**: Basic process performance monitoring

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Prepare two CSV files:
   - `customer_support_data.csv`: Historical data with 'text' and 'category' columns for training
   - `new_tickets.csv`: New tickets with 'id', 'text', 'subject', and 'email' columns

2. Install required Python libraries:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - nltk

### Execution
Run the script `IPA_Demo.py`

## Conclusion

This project showcases the integration of RPA (data extraction), AI (text classification), and process analytics, demonstrating a practical implementation of IPA concepts. It can be extended with more advanced features like sentiment analysis, real-time learning, and integration with actual business systems for a more comprehensive IPA solution.
