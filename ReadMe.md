# Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) Demonstration Project

This project demonstrates Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) by combining RPA, AI, and process analytics. It automates customer support ticket classification and routing, incorporating machine learning for intelligent decision-making, sentiment analysis, and real-time learning capabilities.

## Project: Intelligent Customer Support Ticket Automation

### Objective
Develop an advanced IPA system that automatically classifies incoming customer support tickets, analyzes sentiment, routes them to the appropriate department, and provides tailored initial responses based on historical data and real-time learning.

### Components
1. **RPA**: Automate ticket extraction from email/web forms
2. **AI/ML**: Classify tickets, analyze sentiment, and generate context-aware initial responses
3. **Process Analytics**: Monitor system performance and provide insights
4. **Real-Time Learning**: Continuously improve the model based on new data
5. **Business System Integration**: Placeholder for integration with actual ticketing and email systems

### Implementation
Python-based implementation demonstrating the concept: `IPA_Demo.py`

## Key IPA Concepts Demonstrated

1. **RPA**: Automated ticket extraction (simulated with CSV reading)
2. **AI/ML**: 
   - Text classification using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
   - Sentiment analysis using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
3. **Process Automation**: 
   - Automatic ticket routing
   - Sentiment-aware initial response generation
4. **Analytics**: Basic process performance monitoring
5. **Real-Time Learning**: Framework for continuous model improvement (placeholder)
6. **Business System Integration**: Placeholders for ticketing system and email integration

## New Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Analyzes the sentiment of each ticket
   - Modifies responses based on detected sentiment
2. **Enhanced Response Generation**: 
   - Generates responses considering both ticket category and sentiment
3. **Extensibility for Real-Time Learning**: 
   - Structure allows for periodic model retraining with new data
4. **Integration Placeholders**: 
   - Includes placeholder functions for integration with actual business systems

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Prepare two CSV files:
   - `customer_support_data.csv`: Historical data with 'text' and 'category' columns for training
   - `new_tickets.csv`: New tickets with 'id', 'text', 'subject', and 'email' columns

2. Install required Python libraries:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - nltk

### Execution
Run the script `IPA_Demo.py`

## Conclusion

This enhanced project showcases a comprehensive integration of RPA (data extraction), advanced AI techniques (text classification and sentiment analysis), and process analytics. It demonstrates a practical implementation of IPA concepts with added features like sentiment-aware responses and a framework for real-time learning. The modular design allows for easy extension and integration with actual business systems, providing a foundation for a robust, production-ready IPA solution.
